## Description
This homework project required you to build a Node.js command-line application.  It had to take in user input in response to questions about the team to be generated and then would build a html page to display them in the form of employee cards. 
## Installation
To install first clone the repo.  Then install npm init, npm i inquirer.  You will then be able to run it by making sure you are in the folder with the index.js and running node index.js. Then simple follow the instructions / questions and your html page will be generated.
## Usage
When you run node index.js you will be asked which role would you like to add to the team Manager, Engineer or Interm.  once you are finished added team members just select 'finish building my team' and your html will be generated in the Output folder.
